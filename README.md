About

This project analyzes crop yield data collected from enumerators' surveys during a crop cuts experiment process. It merges survey data from multiple visits (box placement, wet harvest, dry harvest) and calculates average yields per hectare per district. The analysis identifies erroneous data entries, spatially visualizes data points on a map, and explores major factors affecting crop yields by district.

Key Features:
Data cleaning and merging of survey forms using Python pandas
Identification and filtering of erroneous data entries
Calculation of average yield per hectare (Metric Tonnes/Ha)
Spatial visualization of data points on a map using GeoPandas and Matplotlib
Tools and Technologies:
Python
pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib
GitHub (Version control and project hosting)
This repository serves as a demonstration of data analysis techniques applied to agricultural survey data, providing insights into crop yield patterns and data quality issues.
